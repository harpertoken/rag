## Code Style

The following tools ensure consistent and high-quality code:

| Tool           | Purpose                  |
| -------------- | ------------------------ |
| **Black**      | Code formatting          |
| **Flake8**     | Linting                  |
| **Mypy**       | Type checking            |
| **isort**      | Import sorting           |
| **pre-commit** | Automates quality checks |

### Pre-commit Hooks

Enable automated checks before every commit:

```bash
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

(Optional) Run hooks on all files:

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

> 💡 If a check fails, fix the issues and retry your commit.

### Manual Checks

```bash
black .
isort .
flake8
mypy .
```

Or run all checks together:

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```
